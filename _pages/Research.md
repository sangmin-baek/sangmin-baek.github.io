My research focuses on developing innovative robotic systems with unique locomotion capabilities. I draw inspiration from biological systems and integrate soft robotic components and origami-inspired mechanisms to address design-related challenges. Additionally, I utilize smart actuators such as shape memory alloys (SMA) and employ various fabrication methods, including Smart Composite Microstructures (SCM) fabrication, CNC machining, laser machining, and 3D printing. By leveraging these design and manufacturing techniques, I have developed a variety of novel robots.

Beyond mechanism design, I also work on embedded system development. Since untethered robots have strict payload limitations, minimizing the weight of electronic components is crucial. To address this, I design custom controller hardware using MCUs and develop firmware to manage low-level robot control. Recognizing the critical role of both design and control in a robot’s performance, I am continuously expanding my expertise in robot control.
